# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

## Project Description: 
The primary goal of this project was to analyze marketing campaign performance data from various advertising platforms, focusing on metrics such as spend, impressions, clicks, and conversions. This analysis provided insights into the effectiveness of different campaigns.

## Key Metrics Calculated:
* CPC (Cost Per Click): determines the cost advertisers pay for each click on their ads.
* CPM (Cost Per Mile): represents the cost per thousand impressions of an advertisement.
* CTR (Click Through Rate): measures the ratio of clicks to impressions for an ad.
* ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) calculates the return generated by marketing efforts compared to the expenses.

## Main Stages:
1.	Data Extraction and Aggregation:
* Wrote SQL queries to aggregate daily spending, impressions, clicks, and conversion values for each Facebook campaign.
* Calculated performance metrics using SQL functions.
2.	Data Integration:
* Combined data from Facebook and Google Ads using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and joins.
* Ensured all relevant data were included for further analysis and visualization.
3.	Data Visualization:
* Created interactive dashboards in Google Looker Studio.
* Developed charts and a table to visualize trends and compare performance across campaigns and platforms. Link to visualization [Google Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/79074f6a-070d-45cf-abd6-9f61e82523d5/page/6gexD)
4.	Advanced Analysis:
* This task focused on analyzing changes in campaign performance metrics over time. I used SQL window functions to compare the current month's metrics with the previous month's for each campaign. Additionally, I calculated the percentage change for CPC, CTR, CPM, and ROMI to identify trends in campaign effectiveness.
